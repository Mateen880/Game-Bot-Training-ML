# Game-Bot-Training-ML
# ðŸ¤– AI Game Bot for 2D Fighting Game â€“ MLP-Based Action Prediction

A machine learning-powered bot trained to mimic player behavior in a 2D fighting game. The bot uses real-time game state data to predict and simulate player button presses using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model trained on historical gameplay.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### ðŸŽ® Real-Time Action Prediction  
- Predicts player button combinations (A, B, X, Y, etc.) based on current game state  
- Supports dynamic behavior for both Player 1 and Player 2

### ðŸ§  Deep Learning with MLP  
- Trained using a custom neural network built with **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Uses `binary_crossentropy` loss for multi-label classification  
- Trained on realistic gameplay collected through manual keyboard inputs

### ðŸ“¦ Data Pipeline  
- Preprocessed gameplay logs from `GameState.csv`  
- Cleans and scales data, handles missing values, normalizes input features  
- Applies threshold-based binary conversion to model predictions

### ðŸŽ¯ Button Mapping & Automation  
- Maps predictions directly to virtual button states using custom logic  
- Simulates real player control using keyboard-style mappings (left, right, jump, crouch, etc.)
